- **Features**: Proper 404, 400, 500 responses with detailed messages
- **Benefit**: Professional error responses for debugging and user feedback

### 3. Path Validation Robustness [ENHANCED]
- **Enhancement**: Improved workspace path handling for both absolute and relative paths
- **Features**: Graceful fallback for missing directories
- **Benefit**: Better user experience with informative error messages

### 4. Web UI Integration [CORRECTED]
- **Fix**: Updated web UI API endpoints to match backend implementation
- **Enhancement**: Fixed generateData endpoint URL structure
- **Impact**: Seamless integration between frontend and backend
